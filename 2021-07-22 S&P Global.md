## Attendees
- Noemi Fumagalli <Noemi.Fumagalli@spglobal.com>

## Background
- Noemi and I worked onboarding a dataset for one of the PM's at Winton (Mehdi Ali).
- S&P Global have multiple areas of business - S&P Global Ratings, S&P Dow Jones Indecies, and their data vendor arm S&P Global Market Intelligence
- S&P Global Market Intelligence (S&P MI herein) are a vendor/distributor for numerous datasets, not just index data or companies listed on them
- I consider their [Data Catalogue](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/) to be the gold standard amongst data vendors
	- Easy searching and filtering capabilities
	- Per dataset decriptions and themes
	- Data schema's and sample data are included
	- Simple linking to the data in snowflake

## Datasets
The following datasets were highlighted as of interest

### ESG

Noemi stated that at this time not many quants have been able to derive alpha from ESG data. I would counter this by asking if this indicates that there is no alpha to capture from the data.

#### [S&P Global ESG Scores](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/s-p-global-esg-scores-(171))

A derived score of company level ESG information. Though we are not interested in it, it is a single derived score rather than the raw data, the methodology for deriving the score was interesting.

1. S&P MI contact companies with a questionnaire to self report their emissions
2. They cross check this against data from [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en) a not-for-profit charity which tracks company disclosures
3. They apply a predictive model to the results to highlight outliers
4. If the reported results do not align with CDP or the model the company is contact to find out why

#### [Trucost](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/search-results?search=Trucost)

[Trucost](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/trucost) estimates the hidden cost of unsustainable use of natural resources by companies. S&P MI have had a controlling stake in the company since Q4 2016.

They offer multiple datasets that could be used to create a derived Envionmental score for companies based on greenhouse gas emissions, pollutants, waste disposal, and resource use.

**Possible Candidate**

### [Global Machine Readable Filings](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/global-machine-readable-filings-(197))

A dataset comprising of machine readable filings for Natural Language Processing. The data could be used to identify upcoming events that are missed by human analysts - M&A plans, new products, resource shortages, etc...

This sounds great, but the work required to build an accurate NLP model may be problematic.

## Commercials
It was indicated that S&P MI could be open to a commercial agreement where we are able to onboard the data, and our clients pay S&P MI for it.

In addition, they offer a research based licensing model where the data can be provided at a reduced cost.

Finally, if we feel that a dataset would be of use they are willing to offer a trial of the data for us to work on.

We would need to discuss terms with them if we think any of their data is useful.

## Other
Snowflake was mentioned as there preffered method for delivery and consumption. As data is stored in the cloud we could lose the point-in-time nature if they publish revisions.


## Follow-up
- [ ] Noemi to provide access to the Data Catalogue
- [ ] Luke to check if anyone else wants access
- [ ] Noemi to highlight the datasets that were discussed
- [ ] Luke to contact CDP to find out what they offer
- [ ] Follow-up meeting in September
