## Attendees
- Noemi Fumagalli <Noemi.Fumagalli@spglobal.com>

## Background
- Noemi and I worked onboarding a dataset for one of the PM's at Winton (Mehdi Ali).
- S&P Global have multiple areas of business - S&P Global Ratings, S&P Dow Jones Indecies, and their data vendor arm S&P Global Market Intelligence
- S&P Global Market Intelligence (S&P MI herein) are a vendor/distributor for numerous datasets, not just index data or companies listed on them
- I consider their [Data Catalogue](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/) to be the gold standard amongst data vendors
	- Easy searching and filtering capabilities
	- Per dataset decriptions and themes
	- Data schema's and sample data are included
	- Simple linking to the data in snowflake

## Datasets
The following datasets were highlighted as of interest

### ESG
#### [S&P Global ESG Scores](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/s-p-global-esg-scores-(171))

A derived score of company level ESG information. Though we are not interested in it, it is a single derived score rather than the raw data, the methodology for deriving the score was interesting.

1. S&P MI contact companies with a questionnaire to self report their emissions
2. They cross check this against data from [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en) a not-for-profit charity which tracks company disclosures
