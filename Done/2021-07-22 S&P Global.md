- Noemi Fumagalli <Noemi.Fumagalli@spglobal.com>

## Background

- Noemi and I worked onboarding a dataset for one of the PM's at Winton

- S&P Global have multiple areas of business - S&P Global Ratings, S&P Dow Jones Indices, and their data vendor arm S&P Global Market Intelligence

- S&P Global Market Intelligence (S&P MI herein) are a vendor/distributor for numerous datasets, not just S&P index data or companies listed on them

- I consider their [Data Catalogue](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/) to be the gold standard amongst data vendors

 - Easy searching and filtering capabilities

 - Per dataset descriptions and themes

 - Data schema's and sample data

 - Simple linking to the data in snowflake

## Datasets

Noemi highlighted the following datasets as being potentially of interest.

### ESG

Noemi stated that not many quants have been able to derive alpha from ESG data at this time. I will counter this by asking if this indicates there is no alpha to capture from ESG data.

#### [S&P Global ESG Scores](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/s-p-global-esg-scores-(171))

A derived score of company-level ESG information. Though we are not interested in it, it is a single derived score rather than the raw data. The methodology for deriving the score was interesting.

1. S&P MI contact companies with a questionnaire to self report their emissions

2. They cross-check this against data from [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en), a not-for-profit charity that tracks company disclosures

3. They apply a predictive model to the results to highlight outliers

4. If the reported results do not align with CDP or the model, the company is contacted to find out why

**No interest**

#### [Trucost](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/search-results?search=Trucost)

[Trucost](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/trucost) estimates the hidden cost of unsustainable use of natural resources by companies. S&P MI has had a controlling stake in the company since Q4 2016.

They offer multiple datasets that could be used to create an Environmental derived score for companies based on greenhouse gas emissions, pollutants, waste disposal, and resource use.

**Possible Candidate**

### [Global Machine Readable Filings](https://www.marketplace.spglobal.com/en/datasets/global-machine-readable-filings-(197))

A dataset comprising of machine-readable filings for Natural Language Processing. The data could be used to identify upcoming events that are missed by human analysts - M&A plans, new products, resource shortages, etc...

This sounds great, but the work required to build an accurate NLP model may be problematic.

**No interest**

## Commercials

It was indicated that S&P MI could be open to a commercial agreement where we are able to onboard the data and our clients pay S&P MI for it.

In addition, they offer a research-based licensing model where the data can be provided at a reduced cost.

Finally, if we feel that a dataset would be of use, they are willing to offer a trial of the data for us to work on.

We will need to discuss terms with them if we want to pursue a dataset.

## Other

Snowflake was mentioned as their preferred method for delivery and consumption. As data is stored in the cloud, we could lose the point-in-time nature if they publish revisions.

## Follow-up

- [ ] Noemi to provide access to the Data Catalogue

- [ ] Luke to check if anyone else wants access

- [ ] Noemi to highlight the datasets that were discussed

- [ ] Luke to contact CDP to find out what they offer

- [ ] Follow-up meeting in September
